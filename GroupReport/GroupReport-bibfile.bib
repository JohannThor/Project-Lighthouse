  abstract="Degradation of the visual system can lead to a dramatic reduction of mobility by limiting a person to his sense of touch and hearing. This paper presents the development of an obstacle detection system for visually impaired people. While moving in his environment the user is alerted to close obstacles in range. The system we propose detects an obstacle surrounding the user by using a multi-sonar system and sending appropriate vibrotactile feedback. The system aims at increasing the mobility of visually impaired people by offering new sensing abilities. ",

  year="2005",
  volume="19",
  number="2",
  pages="117--140",
  abstract="We propose a new cooperative fusion approach between stereovision and laser scanner in order to take advantage of the best features and cope with the drawbacks of these two sensors to perform robust, accurate and real time-detection of multi-obstacles in the automotive context. The proposed system is able to estimate the position and the height, width and depth of generic obstacles at video frame rate (25 frames per second). The vehicle pitch, estimated by stereovision, is used to filter laser scanner raw data. Objects out of the road are removed using road lane information computed by stereovision. Various fusion schemes are proposed and one is experimented. Results of experiments in real driving situations (multi-pedestrians and multi-vehicles detection) are presented and stress the benefits of our approach.",
